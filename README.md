# Esp-idf-c++-template

## This is the template for the ESP-IDF projects with components.
This project has default component named TestComponent and its projects can be configured running the menuconfig.

## Component configurations:
* Run the menuconfig and in that we would be finding Abiots Test Component. 
* To access the config in the code start with CONFIG_ and we could find all the configurations.

## The Abiots directory is structured as follows:

| File / Folder | Contents                                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

| images        | Project Images Directory                           |
| app/components    | All the Abiots Components                      |
| app/lib           | Abiots Core library                            |
| app/test          | Test code                                      |
